(: Challenging Set :)

(: Question 1 :)
(: Return the title of the course with the largest enrollment. :)

(: Question 2 :)
(: Return course numbers of courses that have the same title as some other course. :)
(: (Hint: You might want to use the "preceding" and "following" navigation axes for :)
(: this query, which were not covered in the video or our demo script; they match any preceding or following node, not just siblings.) :)

(: Question 8 :)
(: Return a "Professors" element that contains as subelements a listing of all professors :)
(: in all departments, sorted by last name with each professor appearing once. The "Professor" :)
(: subelements should have the same structure as in the original data. For this question, :)

(: Question 9 :)
(: Expanding on the previous question, create an inverted course listing: Return an :)

(: have distinct last names. The "Professor" subelements should have the same structure :)
